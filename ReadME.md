## ⚙️ Get Started: Setting Up Your Agent ⚙️

Ready to empower your research? Follow these simple steps:

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed on your system:

-   Python 3.x (because Python is awesome! 😎)
-   Git (for seamless project cloning) 🌳

### 💾 Installation Steps

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/web-research-agent.git](https://github.com/yourusername/web-research-agent.git)
    cd web-research-agent
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment to keep things tidy and activate it:

    ```bash
    # For Linux/macOS
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  Install all the necessary dependencies like a pro:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 🔑 Configuration is Key

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2.  Populate the `.env` file with your API keys. Keep these secret! 🤫

    ```dotenv
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
    SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key
    ```

## 🚀 Usage: Let the Research Begin! 🚀

1.  Fire up the Flask server and get the agent running:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the specific port your application indicates).
3.  Type your research query into the provided input field and hit the "Research" button. Watch the magic happen! ✨

## ⚠️ Important Notes: Handling Hiccups and Understanding Limits ⚠️

### 🚧 Current Considerations

1.  **External API Dependence:** This agent relies on the availability and limits of external services like SerpAPI and Google Gemini. Keep an eye on their status and your usage. 👀
2.  **Web Scraping Nuances:** Extracting information from the ever-evolving web can be tricky. Websites with complex JavaScript or anti-scraping mechanisms might pose challenges. 🕸️
3.  **Processing Time Factors:** Intricate research queries that require extensive searching and in-depth analysis might take a bit longer to process. Please be patient! ⏳
4.  **Concurrency Capacity:** The current setup might have limitations on handling a flood of simultaneous requests. Think of it as a bouncer at a club – there's a limit to how many can enter at once (e.g., up to 3 concurrent requests). 🚪
